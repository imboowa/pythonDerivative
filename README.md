# pythonDerivative

# Overview
This is a simple Python program that takes inn a list of points on a curve and find their derivative on that given function. It demonstrates basic **calculus**. I have taken this project up while I am learning machine learning. This program does not include a graphical user interface; all output is displayed in the terminal or console.
It shows a function(line) then it finds the derivative at each point respecting X, so it takes in point X and return the derivative(slope) at that point. I am not good at this but this was so nice to do that I was excited to publish this code, no AI just my brain.

# Features
Displays the point on the **curve(function) : derivative** as a **key, value** pair.
It is contains functions and demonstrates basic usage of Python's functions.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
**IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**
A terminal or console to run the script

# Installation
Clone this repository or download the program files.
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the program using the following command:
```bash
python fileName.py
```
or
```bash
python3 fileName.py
```
The point and derivative will be printed as key, value pairs.
