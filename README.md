# pythonDerivative

*******Overview*******

This is a simple Python program that takes inn a list of points on a curve and find their derivative on that given function. It demonstrates basic **calculus**. I have taken this project up while I am learning machine learning. This program does not include a graphical user interface; all output is displayed in the terminal or console.

**Features**

Displays the point on the **curve(function): derivative** as a **key, value** pair.

It is contains functions

Demonstrates basic usage of Python's functions.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

**IDE(Integrated Development Environment)**

A terminal or console to run the script

**Installation**

Clone this repository or download the program files.

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Usage**

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the program using the following command:
